    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-   The primary goal of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, as with any other language, is to allow developers to create reusable and modular code that is easy to maintain and understand. OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods), which can be used to model complex systems and interactions between different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, OOP is implemented using classes, which allow you to define the attributes and methods of an object. By creating classes and objects, you can encapsulate your code and make it more modular, which makes it easier to test and maintain. Additionally, OOP allows you to create new objects that inherit properties and behaviors from existing objects, which can save you time and effort when building complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary goal of OOP in Python is to provide developers with a powerful and flexible tool for building complex, modular, and maintainable code.\n",

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-   In Python, an object is an instance of a class that has attributes and methods. A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, which defines the attributes and methods that the object will have. An object is an instance of that class, which means that it has all the attributes and methods defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have a class called \"Car\" that defines the attributes and methods of a car. You can create an object of the Car class by instantiating it, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we defined a Car class with three attributes (make, model, and year), and a constructor method (_init_) that initializes those attributes with the values passed as arguments. We then created an object of the Car class called \"my_car\" by calling the Car constructor and passing in the make, model, and year values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, \"my_car\" is an object of the Car class, which means it has the make, model, and year attributes defined by the class. You can access these attributes using dot notation, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_car.make)\n",
    "print(my_car.model)\n",
    "print(my_car.year)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Toyota\n",
    "Camry\n",
    "2021\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an object in Python is an instance of a class that has attributes and methods defined by the class. You can create objects of a class by instantiating it, and you can access the attributes and methods of an object using dot notation."

    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-  Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.    The simplest form of class definition looks like this:\n",

    "class ClassName:\n",

    "    <statement-N>\n",
    "Class definitions, like function definitions (def statements) must be executed before they have any effect. (You could conceivably place a class definition in a branch of an if statement, or inside a function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful — we’ll come back to this later. The function definitions inside a class normally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again, this is explained later.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class definition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all assignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function definitions bind the name of the new function here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class definition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper around the contents of the namespace created by the class definition; we’ll learn more about class objects in the next section. The original local scope (the one in effect just before the class definition was entered) is reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class definition header (ClassName in the example)."

    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-  Attributes of a class are function objects that define corresponding methods of its instances. They are used to implement access controls of the classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, \"wheels\" is a class variable that is defined inside the Car class. It is accessed using the class name \"Car\" and is shared among all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance variable, on the other hand, is defined inside the constructor method (_init_) and is unique to each instance of the class. Instance variables are useful for defining values that are specific to each instance of a class. For example:\n",

    "class Car:\n",

    "another_car = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2022)\n",
    "print(another_car.make)  # Output: Honda\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, \"make\", \"model\", and \"year\" are instance variables that are defined inside the Car constructor method. Each instance of the Car class has its own values for these variables.\n",
